          <h6>Americans Are No Longer Spending Time Outdoors</h6>
          <p class="text">
            Today, Americans spend an average of six hours per day plugged into electronic media.
            Research shows that children, in particular, are spending half as much time outdoors
            as they did 20 years ago. According to the National Parks and Recreation Association,
            children today spend less time outdoors than any other generation, devoting only four
            to seven minutes to unstructured outdoor play per day while spending an average of
            seven and a half hours in front of electronic media.

          <h6>Our Mission</h6>
          <p class="text1">
            New Mexico Wildlife Federation’s (NMWF) mission is to inspire New Mexicans to conserve public
            landscapes, watersheds and wildlife for our children’s future.  This mission includes getting
            youth involved in experiencing nature and pursing outdoor adventures while learning to be
            environmentally responsible.
          </p>
          <p class="text1">
            NMWF is on the ground tackling the issue of Nature Deficit Disorder.  By focusing on three
            programmatic areas, we propose connecting the community to rivers, public land and wildlife
            through community and youth engagement.

          <h3 class="lead">What is Nature Deficit Disorder?</h3>
          <h6>Importance of Nature</h6>
          <p class="text1">
            Across the nation, obesity rates have tripled.  Doctors warn that for the first time in
            American history, life expectancy may decrease.  Two works, Richard Louv’s Last Child in
            the Woods and Scott Sampson’s, How to Raise a Wild Child describe this trend and use the
            disturbing name “Nature Deficit Disorder.”
          </p>
          <p class="text1">
            Among the side effects of children not being connected with nature are increases in the
            diagnoses of ADHD, obesity, depression, anxiety-based disorders, autism, stress and
            aggression.  Another scary proposition is that if children do not experience nature,
            they will be less likely to want to conserve nature in the future.  Meaning that we
            could have a generation of people who do nothing to preserve our land, wildlife and
            culture.
